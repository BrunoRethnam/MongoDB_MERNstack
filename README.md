The House Rent App is a web application developed using the MERN stack (MongoDB, Express.js, React.js, Node.js) that simplifies the process of searching for and managing rental properties. It features user 
authentication for tenants and landlords, allows browsing and searching of property listings, and provides management tools for landlords to add and edit their listings. Users can also create profiles, save 
favorite properties, and leave reviews and ratings. To set up the app, clone the repository, install the necessary dependencies for both the backend and frontend, and start the servers. Open the app in your browser 
at http://localhost:3000.
